abstract = {This work addresses the task-space design prob- lem of a linear-quadratic optimal tracking controller for robotic manipulators using the unit dual quaternion formalism. The efficiency, compactness, and lack of singularity of the representation render the unit dual quaternion a suitable framework for simultaneously describing the attitude and the position of the end-effector. Motivated by the advantages of this kinematic description, we propose a new task-space linear- quadratic optimal tracking controller in order to find an optimal trajectory for the end-effector, providing a tool to balance more conveniently the end-effector error and its task- space velocity. This is possible because the kinematic control problem using the dual quaternion transformation invariant error can be reduced to an affine time-varying system. The proposed optimal tracking controller allows the compensation of trajectory induced disturbances, as well as other modeled additive disturbances and known bias. Simulation results with different design parameters provide a performance overview, in comparison with standard kinematic controllers with and without a feed-forward term, for tracking a desired reference.},

abstract = {Background and aim: A 32-year-old woman presented with a 10-year history of left side ulcerative colitis treated only with oral and topic mesalazine until April 2006. Last relapse in April 2006 treated with 20 days topic methylprednisolone. No pancolonoscopy was performed before. Material and methods: A surveillance ileo-colonoscopy was performed without premedication using a pediatric colonoscope Fuji EC-250-MP-5. The cecum was reached without difficulties. The mucosa had sign of minimal active inflammation only in the rectum. Biopsy specimens were taken from the ileum to the distal rectum (4 for each segment) to evaluate the extension of disease and the presence of dysplasia. We used biopsy forceps with needle Olympus FB-24U-1 (2300 mm). Neither insertion of the colonoscope nor its withdrawal with sampling created any significant pain. At the end of colonoscopy the patient referred abdominal discomfort and was kept in observation for about 2 hours. The examination did not reveal clinical sign of perforation, hemodynamic parameters were normal and after application of rectal probe and rectal expulsion of air she referred improve of abdominal discomfort and was discharged. In the afternoon she experienced abdominal pain and growing of abdominal circumference; the physical examination revealed sign of acute abdomen and abdomen x-ray revealed a massive pneumoperitoneum. An immediate laparotomy was performed that did not reveal evident perforation; pneumatic evaluation with water revealed minimal loss of air in more than one site of biopsy, that was known because of presence of little hematomas in the colon wall. Defects were sutured and the patient's further hospital course was uneventful. Results: All biopsy showed severe mucosal atrophy with almost absent submucosa, and in more than one specimens were present also muscle of the muscularis propria. Conclusions: Biopsy-related perforation is a rare complication of colonoscopy with modern flexible colonoscope and small caliber biopsy forceps, nevertheless it cannot be totally excluded, particularly in a patient with clinical suspicion of severe mucosa atrophy like patient affected by ulcerative colitis even if without large use of corticosteroid therapy.},

abstract = {Needle steering devices present great potential for improving the safety and accuracy of medical interventions with percutaneous access. Despite significant advances in the field, needle steerability remains an issue to be solved by the scientific community. In this paper, we propose the use of discrete steps in flexible needle insertion, inspired by the manual procedure performed by physicians. Conceptually, the method relies in alternating between two motions: grasp-push and release-retreat. For experimental evaluation, a modified gripper is used along with a 6DOF robotic manipulator to control needle insertion velocity, rotation and grasping. Preliminary results indicate that the use of discrete steps minimizes some negative effects, such as slippage and needle buckling, observed on alternative methods, while preserving their functional advantages.},

abstract = {Robotic assistance allows surgeons to perform dexterous and tremor-free procedures, but robotic aid is still underrepresented in procedures with constrained workspaces, such as deep brain neurosurgery and endonasal surgery. In those, surgeons have restricted vision to areas near the surgical tool tips, which increases the risk of unexpected collisions between the shafts of the instruments and their surroundings, in special when those parts are outside the surgical field-of-view. Dynamic active constraints can be used to prevent collisions between moving instruments and prevent damage to static or moving tissues. In this work, our vector field inequality method is extended to provide dynamic active constraints to any number of robots and moving objects sharing the same workspace. The method is evaluated in experiments and simulations in which the robot tools have to avoid collisions, autonomously and in real-time, with a constrained endonasal surgical environment and between each other. Results show that both manipulator-manipulator and manipulator-boundary collisions can be effectively prevented using the vector field inequalities.},

The control strategy is based on a cascade scheme composed of an outer loop that takes into account all DOF and an inner loop that explicitly deals with the nonholonomic constraints of the mobile base. The comparison is performed between two techniques applied at the outer loop to deal with the whole-body motion, namely a traditional approach that uses the pseudoinverse of the robot Jacobian matrix and the parsimonious control recently introduced by Gon{\c{c}}alves et al. [1]. Experiments on a real robot show that the parsimonious approach uses fewer actuators than the traditional approach at the expense of more abrupt control signals.},

Abstract— This paper deals with the consensus problem of multiple mobile manipulators. The system is modeled by using dual quaternion algebra and two problems are considered: the rendezvous problem and the pose consensus of the end-effectors with local frames. In order to perform the local control of the mobile manipulators, a hierarchical approach is used such that two tasks are executed simultaneously with different priorities. The proposed technique is evaluated in simulation, which shows that the system stabilizes when the consensus is achieved.},

  abstract      = {— This paper presents a technique for the modeling and balance control of humanoid robots based on dual quaternion algebra and the Cooperative Dual Task-Space Framework. A strategy for controlling the Center of Mass (CoM) position that takes into account the system's stability constraints is presented and validated in a realistic simulation. The results show that the presented control strategy is able to track a desired 3D trajectory for the CoM while ensuring the robot's balance, and may potentially be extended to perform bipedal locomotion. Keywords— Humanoid robots, Center of Mass (CoM), CoM control, Dual quaternion, Cooperative Dual Task-Space (CDTS).

  abstract      = {This paper presents a novel approach for the description of physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) tasks that involve two-arm coordination, and where tasks are described by the relative pose between the human hand and the robot hand. We develop a unified kinematic model that takes into account the human-robot system from a holistic point of view, and we also propose a kinematic control strategy for pHRI that comprises different levels of shared autonomy. Since the kinematic model takes into account the complete human-robot interaction system and the kinematic control law is closed loop at the interaction level, the kinematic constraints of the task are enforced during its execution. Experiments are performed in order to validate the proposed approach, including a particular case where the robot controls the human arm by means of functional electrical stimulation (FES), which may potentially provide useful solutions for the interaction between assistant robots and impaired individuals (e.g., quadriplegics and hemiplegics).},

We propose three different H∞ control criteria that ensure asymptotic convergence, whereas reducing the influence of disturbances upon the system stability. Also, with a new metric of dual quaternion error in SE(3) we prove independence from robot coordinate changes. Simulation results highlight the importance and effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of performance, robustness, and energy efficiency.},
