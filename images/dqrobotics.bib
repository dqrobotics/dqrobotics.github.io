abstract = {This work addresses the task-space design prob- lem of a linear-quadratic optimal tracking controller for robotic manipulators using the unit dual quaternion formalism. The efficiency, compactness, and lack of singularity of the representation render the unit dual quaternion a suitable framework for simultaneously describing the attitude and the position of the end-effector. Motivated by the advantages of this kinematic description, we propose a new task-space linear- quadratic optimal tracking controller in order to find an optimal trajectory for the end-effector, providing a tool to balance more conveniently the end-effector error and its task- space velocity. This is possible because the kinematic control problem using the dual quaternion transformation invariant error can be reduced to an affine time-varying system. The proposed optimal tracking controller allows the compensation of trajectory induced disturbances, as well as other modeled additive disturbances and known bias. Simulation results with different design parameters provide a performance overview, in comparison with standard kinematic controllers with and without a feed-forward term, for tracking a desired reference.},

abstract = {Background and aim: A 32-year-old woman presented with a 10-year history of left side ulcerative colitis treated only with oral and topic mesalazine until April 2006. Last relapse in April 2006 treated with 20 days topic methylprednisolone. No pancolonoscopy was performed before. Material and methods: A surveillance ileo-colonoscopy was performed without premedication using a pediatric colonoscope Fuji EC-250-MP-5. The cecum was reached without difficulties. The mucosa had sign of minimal active inflammation only in the rectum. Biopsy specimens were taken from the ileum to the distal rectum (4 for each segment) to evaluate the extension of disease and the presence of dysplasia. We used biopsy forceps with needle Olympus FB-24U-1 (2300 mm). Neither insertion of the colonoscope nor its withdrawal with sampling created any significant pain. At the end of colonoscopy the patient referred abdominal discomfort and was kept in observation for about 2 hours. The examination did not reveal clinical sign of perforation, hemodynamic parameters were normal and after application of rectal probe and rectal expulsion of air she referred improve of abdominal discomfort and was discharged. In the afternoon she experienced abdominal pain and growing of abdominal circumference; the physical examination revealed sign of acute abdomen and abdomen x-ray revealed a massive pneumoperitoneum. An immediate laparotomy was performed that did not reveal evident perforation; pneumatic evaluation with water revealed minimal loss of air in more than one site of biopsy, that was known because of presence of little hematomas in the colon wall. Defects were sutured and the patient's further hospital course was uneventful. Results: All biopsy showed severe mucosal atrophy with almost absent submucosa, and in more than one specimens were present also muscle of the muscularis propria. Conclusions: Biopsy-related perforation is a rare complication of colonoscopy with modern flexible colonoscope and small caliber biopsy forceps, nevertheless it cannot be totally excluded, particularly in a patient with clinical suspicion of severe mucosa atrophy like patient affected by ulcerative colitis even if without large use of corticosteroid therapy.},

abstract = {Needle steering devices present great potential for improving the safety and accuracy of medical interventions with percutaneous access. Despite significant advances in the field, needle steerability remains an issue to be solved by the scientific community. In this paper, we propose the use of discrete steps in flexible needle insertion, inspired by the manual procedure performed by physicians. Conceptually, the method relies in alternating between two motions: grasp-push and release-retreat. For experimental evaluation, a modified gripper is used along with a 6DOF robotic manipulator to control needle insertion velocity, rotation and grasping. Preliminary results indicate that the use of discrete steps minimizes some negative effects, such as slippage and needle buckling, observed on alternative methods, while preserving their functional advantages.},

abstract = {Robotic assistance allows surgeons to perform dexterous and tremor-free procedures, but robotic aid is still underrepresented in procedures with constrained workspaces, such as deep brain neurosurgery and endonasal surgery. In those, surgeons have restricted vision to areas near the surgical tool tips, which increases the risk of unexpected collisions between the shafts of the instruments and their surroundings, in special when those parts are outside the surgical field-of-view. Dynamic active constraints can be used to prevent collisions between moving instruments and prevent damage to static or moving tissues. In this work, our vector field inequality method is extended to provide dynamic active constraints to any number of robots and moving objects sharing the same workspace. The method is evaluated in experiments and simulations in which the robot tools have to avoid collisions, autonomously and in real-time, with a constrained endonasal surgical environment and between each other. Results show that both manipulator-manipulator and manipulator-boundary collisions can be effectively prevented using the vector field inequalities.},
