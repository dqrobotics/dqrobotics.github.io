About this project
#####################
**DQ Robotics** is a standalone open-source (LGPLv3) library for robot modelling and control. 

Core features
==================
It provides dual quaternion algebra and kinematic calculation algorithms in Python3, Matlab, and C++11.

- Most users will benefit from using the Python3 version at first. It is easy and computationally efficient (C++ code runs under the hood for fast performance).
- Use the MATLAB version if you want to test your ideas fast while having convenient visualization tools, provided you have access to the MathWorks software.
- Use the C++11 version for real-time high-performance applications and if youâ€™re not afraid of pointers.

Support
==================
.. warning::
  Any requests regarding unsupported systems will most likely be ignored.

1. Python3 (Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04 LTS)
2. MATLAB (> 2016a)
